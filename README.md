This is the 8th javascript project from theodinproject curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app).

This project is mainly an implementation of my learning of asynchronous javascript. This project allowed me to put knowcledge about json, apis, promises, ascync/await, and linting into practice. There are two versions of javascript code that this is based off. If you check the branches, you will be able to navigate and see the differences. The main branch shows use of promises, while the async... branch uses async/await syntax.
